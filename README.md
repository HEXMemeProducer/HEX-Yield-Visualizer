Make receiving HEX yield more fun! 
The HEX Yield Visualizer allows HEX investors to see and hear when 
they receive yield from HEX stakes!

This app is free to use. Attribution would be appreciated but is not necessary.
Feel free to use the app in videos, live streams, or on your website.
The code is available to use and alter as you see fit.

HEX_Yield_Visualizer_v1.exe can run on its own without any other files.

The image, sound, and font files are for use with the Python script in the event
you wish to make changes to the application. 
I recommend Python version 3.13 (3.14 does not currently work with this code).

To determine your daily HEX yield, you can add your addresses to https://hexscout.com/portfolio.
HEXscout will calculate how many T-Shares you have and then multiple that by the current
Payout per T-Share. Alternatively, if you already know how many T-shares you have, you can
can multiply that number by the current Payout per T-share, which can be found at https://hexstats.today/.
Click the Settings icon in the app to change the "HEX yield per day" parameter to this number.
The app will use that number to determine the rate at which each HEX should be
deposited into your piggy bank. Naturally, you can use any number you wish,
either for entertainment purposes or to get a feel for the rate at which other HEX investors
are receiving yield.

Your settings will be preserved even when you close and reopen the app.
